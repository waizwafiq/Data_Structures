I am planning to implement data structures concepts using Java as much from scratch as possible.
So far, the data structures that I have implemented are:
  * Dynamic Array
  * Bag
  * Stack
  * Queue
  * Linked List

### I'm planning to implement more data structures (and maybe some useful algorithms)
* Feel free to make a pull request if you can come up with a better/optimized solution.
* If there are issues/bugs, feel free to state it in the "Issues" section
